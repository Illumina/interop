Illumina InterOp Documentation                         {#mainpage}
==============================

Purpose
-------

The Illumina InterOp libraries are a set of common routines used for reading and writing InterOp metric files.  These
metric files are binary files produced during a run providing detailed statistics about a run.  In a few cases, the 
metric files are produced after a run during secondary analysis (index metrics) or for faster display of a subset of 
the original data (collapsed quality scores).

Compatibility
-------------

There are a wide number of platforms that Illumina supports and releases.  The stance has always been to keep SAV 
backwards compatible with prior releases.  This means that these common InterOp libraries need to be backwards 
compatible as well.  There is one exception to this rule: GA systems have been excluded and are not supported with 
these common InterOp libraries.

Known Limitations
-----------------

There are several known limitations to the current library:

  1. You cannot build a shared library on Windows. Our CMake build script disallows it for good reason, it currently
     does not work. You can still use a static library on Windows. There is one caveat, you can build a shared
     library for the SWIG bindings, e.g. C#.
  2. The full logic of SAV including certain metrics and plots are not yet implemented.
  3. Microsoft Dot Net less than v4.0.30319 is currently not supported
  4. MinGW cannot compile the code when ENABLE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY=ON
