Using InterOp in Python      {#python_binding}
=======================

Let's learn by example. Throughout this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps necessary to produce the metrics
in various ways found in SAV.

## Install

If you do not have the Python InterOp library installed, then you can do the following:

    $ pip install -f https://github.com/Illumina/interop/releases/latest interop

Note, only Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 are currently 
supported as binary builds. Other Python versions must be built 
from source.

You can then test the install as follows:
    
    $ python -m interop --test
